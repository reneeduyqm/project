        <p>I started creative writing in my sophomore year of high school
            I do poetry and short stories. In addition to it, I like traveling 
            and traveled to many places. I will write down differnet thoughs and 
            stories which leads me to keep creative writing. This is one of the 
            short stories' openning I wrote when I was in high school.

		<p>It is cold today, but clear, like all the darkness and dirt are cleaned up. 
            “My child,” the sound was dry and hoarse, like a noise, “today, as the Memy,” 
            she paused, “I will impart to you the tale of Christmas.” The Memy has a wizened 
            face and a back slightly hunched. With each movement there was the creak of old bones. 
            The old woman hunched over in her lounge chair, leaning closer to the fire, edging her 
            hands towards the flames to warm them from the bitter evening. The light from the flames 
            illuminated her tired, worn face, wrinkles boring deeply into her skin.
        </p>
        <p>    
            “It was also a cold day, but not clean at all…” All the memories flashed back, like 
            she was back to the night, the cold and painful night she could never erase from her memory.
