		<p>Hi! I am Renee Du. I am currently a sophomore in LSA of the University of Michigan who is applying for the 
			School of Information. So glad that you find my website! I will introduce me through my experiences and hobbies
		    to make you know more about this person: Renee Du.</p>

		<p>The first part is about changing majors. Same as many of other students, I was unsure about my future 
			career when I was in high school. I went to a High school in Brookline, MA (See more in Experience section). 
			In my four years of high school, I discovered my great passion to medical field and developed more hobbies 
			during the exploration time. I am a person who is always there to try new things and will make decisions at
			the moment when I found myself love the thing that I am doing. Therefore, with my enthusiastic, passion, and
			ambition to create a better medical service, I became one of the students in premed.  
		</p>

		<p>If you go to my work section, you will see the work and volunteer I did towards medical and service. Although 
			working in the hospital is the challenging, it is the pace I like as I can always learn something new. However, 
			when I found out that there are some issues we can fix and these problems are causing medical and emotional issues 
			and challenges to the patients and doctors, I want to do something that would save some time. So, here I am, 
			ready to step in Information field.
